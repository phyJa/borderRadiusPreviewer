# Border radius and color previewer

## Introduction
This project is an inspiration of the second idea of the awesome [App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository, where the user can view the `border-radius` property being applied to an HTML element. But here we go a little bit further, allowing the user to change the HTML element color using the RGBA, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (the transparency feature) standard.

## Use
To use the application, access `index.html` and have fun!
